## Type Conversion Sugar

It's not rocket science -- it's just a bunch of functions that convert from one type into another (very similar) type.  I'm sure someone else out there has already done it, and probably better, too.  You should use their library instead.

## Pull Requests Welcome

This library is a work in progress, and will benefit from your experience reports, use cases, and contributions.  If you have an idea for making this library better, send in a pull request.  We're all in this together! ðŸš€
