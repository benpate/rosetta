## Resolve data from arbitrary structures

This is an experimental library for reading/writing values into arbitrary data structures, specifically the `map[string]any` and `[]any` values returned by Go's `json.Unmarshal()` functions.  It is inspired by the JSON-path standard, but has a very simplified syntax -- using a series of strings separated by dots.
