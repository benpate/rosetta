## A Collection of Translation and Data Manipulation Tools

Rosetta combines several different data manipulation tools into a single module.  While each was useful on its own, the dependencies between them made updates hellish, so this collection was born.  

Many of these packages pre-date Go generics, and many are being refactored to take advantage of this new capability.

### What's Included

* [Channel](https://github.com/benpate/rosetta/tree/main/channel) tools for manipulating Go channels
* [Compare](https://github.com/benpate/rosetta/tree/main/compare) values of unknown data types.
* [Convert](https://github.com/benpate/rosetta/tree/main/convert) between arbitrary data types with sensible, configurable defaults.
* [HTML](https://github.com/benpate/rosetta/tree/main/html) conversion tools
* [Iterator](https://github.com/benpate/rosetta/tree/main/iterator) tools for iterating over data structures
* [Maps](https://github.com/benpate/rosetta/tree/main/maps) tools for working with map types
* [Schema](https://github.com/benpate/rosetta/tree/main/schema) validation based on JSON Schema
* [Slice](https://github.com/benpate/rosetta/tree/main/slice) manipulation library
* [Translate](https://github.com/benpate/rosetta/tree/main/translate) data mapping library

### Enhanced Data Types

* [List](https://github.com/benpate/rosetta/tree/main/list) parsing library
* [MapOf](https://github.com/benpate/rosetta/tree/main/mapof) data type with type safe getters/setters
* [Null](https://github.com/benpate/rosetta/tree/main/null)-able data types
* [SliceOf](https://github.com/benpate/rosetta/tree/main/sliceof) data types
